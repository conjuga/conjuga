## Step 1: What Does Avoir Mean?

The verb **avoir** means *to have* in English. It is used to:  

1. Express possession  
   - *J’ai un livre.* → *I have a book.*  
2. Express age (in French, you “have” years)  
   - *J’ai 20 ans.* → *I am 20 years old.*  
3. Form compound tenses (auxiliary role)  
   - *J’ai parlé.* → *I have spoken / I spoke.*  

Because of its dual role, **avoir** is one of the very first verbs French learners must master.

## Step 2: Understanding the Passé Antérieur

The **passé antérieur** is a **literary tense**. You won’t hear it much in conversation, but you will find it in:  

- Novels and stories  
- Historical writing  
- Formal academic texts  

It expresses an action that happened **before another past action**, often introduced by words like *après que* (after), *dès que* (as soon as), or *aussitôt que* (as soon as).  

In spoken French, people usually use the **plus-que-parfait** instead.

## Step 5: Usage Notes for English Speakers

- The passé antérieur is **rarely spoken**. Focus on recognizing it in reading.  
- *Avoir* is **irregular**, so its forms don’t follow the usual -er verb patterns.  
- In English, passé antérieur usually translates as **“had + past participle.”**  
- Because *avoir* is also an auxiliary verb, mastering this form helps you read advanced French texts more confidently.

## Quick Recap

- **Avoir** = *to have* (common and auxiliary verb)  
- **Passé antérieur** = used in literature, before another past action  
- Conjugation: *j’eus eu, tu eus eu, il/elle eut eu, nous eûmes eu, vous eûtes eu, ils/elles eurent eu*  
- In spoken French → replace with **plus-que-parfait**
