Here's how 'parler' is conjugated in the past conditional:

- **Tu aurais parlé** (You would have spoken)
- **Il/Elle/On aurait parlé** (He/She/One would have spoken)
- **Nous aurions parlé** (We would have spoken)
- **Vous auriez parlé** (You would have spoken)
- **Ils/Elles auraient parlé** (They would have spoken)

### Usage Examples:

1. **Si j'avais su, j'aurais parlé plus tôt.** (If I had known, I would have spoken earlier.)
2. **Tu aurais parlé à ma place?** (Would you have spoken in my place?)
3. **Elle aurait parlé si elle avait eu l'occasion.** (She would have spoken if she had had the chance.)
4. **Nous aurions parlé plus longuement si nous avions eu le temps.** (We would have spoken longer if we had had the time.)
5. **Vous auriez parlé différemment si vous aviez su la vérité.** (You would have spoken differently if you had known the truth.)
6. **Ils auraient parlé avec plus de respect s'ils avaient su qui elle était.** (They would have spoken with more respect if they had known who she was.)
