In French grammar, the subjunctive pluperfect tense, also known as le plus-que-parfait du subjonctif, is used to express hypothetical or unreal past actions. The French verb 'Manger' (to eat) in the subjunctive pluperfect might seem challenging, but with consistent practice, it gets easier. Let's dive in!

The subjunctive pluperfect of 'Manger' is built by using the subjunctive present of the auxiliary 'avoir' and the past participle 'mangé'. Here are the conjugations:

- **Que j'eusse mangé** (that I had eaten)
- **Que tu eusses mangé** (that you had eaten)
- **Qu'il/elle/on eût mangé** (that he/she/one had eaten)
- **Que nous eussions mangé** (that we had eaten)
- **Que vous eussiez mangé** (that you had eaten)
- **Qu'ils/elles eussent mangé** (that they had eaten)

### Usage Examples:

1. **Je regrette qu'il eût mangé tout le gâteau.** (I regret that he had eaten all the cake.)
2. **Si seulement tu eusses mangé plus tôt.** (If only you had eaten earlier.)
3. **Elle doute qu'ils eussent mangé sans elle.** (She doubts that they had eaten without her.)

Remember, the subjunctive pluperfect is rarely used in spoken French, but it's important for written French, especially in literature.
