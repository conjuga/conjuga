Mastering the French verb **avoir** (to have) is a cornerstone of French language learning. In the present tense, its conjugations are as follows:

- **J'ai** (I have)
- **Tu as** (You have)
- **Il/Elle/On a** (He/She/It has)
- **Nous avons** (We have)
- **Vous avez** (You have)
- **Ils/Elles ont** (They have)

These conjugations are fundamental for basic communication in French. To illustrate, consider the following examples:

1. **J'ai un livre.** (I have a book.)
2. **Tu as une voiture.** (You have a car.)
3. **Il a une idée.** (He has an idea.)
4. **Nous avons des amis.** (We have friends.)
5. **Vous avez du temps.** (You have time.)
6. **Elles ont une maison.** (They have a house.)

The verb **avoir** is critical for the formation of many common French expressions and tenses, including the subjunctive pluperfect—a less common tense that nonetheless can greatly enhance your understanding of French.
