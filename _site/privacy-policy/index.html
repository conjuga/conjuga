    <p>madeny Inc (or, “madeny”) issues this Privacy Policy to inform you of our procedures and policies regarding the collection, disclosure, and use of personal information madeny receives or collects from users of our applications and/or website. The term “Services”, as used in this Privacy Policy, references both the madeny website (the “Site”) and all madeny applications, games and any other products or services offered by madeny (the “Application(s)”). This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us (or permit third party sites to provide us) or that we collect through the Services. This Privacy Policy will be updated at dates in the future to be determined by madeny. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Services. madeny recommends that you consult this policy periodically for any changes. By using our Services you are consenting to our Processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy now and as revised in the future by madeny. “Processing” means using cookies on a computer or using, reviewing, or otherwise interacting with information in any way, including, but not limited to, storing, deleting, collecting, using, combining and disclosing information and transferring it to US and other governments. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services.</p>

<p>What This Policy Contains</p>

<p>I. Information Collection and Use: Personally Identifiable Information</p>

<p>II. Legal Bases for Use of Your Personal Information</p>

<p>III. Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>

<p>IV. How Long We Store Your Information</p>

<p>V. Your Rights</p>

<p>VI. Security</p>

<p>VII. International Transfer</p>

<p>VIII. Our Policy Towards Children</p>

<p>IX. Phishing</p>

<p>XI. Complaints</p>

<p>XII. Contacting Us</p>

<p>I. Information Collection and Use: Personally Identifiable Information Information That You Provide</p>

<p>As you use the Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to identify, track, or contact you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this information. When you contact our customer support services, this may include a record of communication correspondence and associated contact information. Where applicable, you may sign up to use the Services directly via the Site or Application or via certain third party social networking sites (each, a “Social Networking Site”). If you decide to create an account to use the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the personal information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make available via the Social Networking Site) from the account you have with such Social Networking Site and use that information to create your madeny account, or an account for a madeny application, website, or property; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site. If you choose to purchase any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent available, we or our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods. We also collect other information that you provide in connection with your registration and/or use of the Services (e.g., without limitation, birthday, gender, zip code (on its own), individual preferences and certain information about your computer or mobile device, such as operating system, software version and unique advertising identifier) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). With your permission, we access information from your device, such as your general location, contact lists, photo library, and calendar. If you choose to give us access, you may also link your use of the Services with your cloud storage accounts.</p>

<p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>

<p>Our products may require additional information or permissions from your device in order to function effectively.
Log Data. When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Site, (any of these, a “madeny User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or application (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the website or application you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of the websites or applications involved in the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, operating system, software version, unique advertising identifier, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests, as described in more detail below. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
Cookies. Like many websites and applications, our Service uses “cookies” and mobile advertising identifiers to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while using our Services. An advertising identifier is an anonymous, resettable ID associated with your mobile device that can be managed in your device settings.</p>

Or you have provided us with your consent to do so, including with respect to the advertising and marketing materials delivered via our Services that are tailored to you and your preferences.

III. Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>

<p>madeny Registered Users. If you register through the Services on the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile, for madeny or for any madeny applications, websites, or services, other registered users will see your “User Name” (“Subscriber Identifier”). Third-Party Advertisers: Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information; Advertisers. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. In particular, we share Non-Identifying Information (including the advertising identifier currently associated with your device) and Log Data and other aggregated information with third party advertising and technology companies. The data we share with them includes data about your device, location, and use of our Applications, including IP address, device identifiers and information, Application usage data, and purchase data as well as information you provide to us when using our Applications such as game progress and certain technical information. Such information may be used to send you targeted advertisements for products and services that are relevant to your interests. In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, such as aggregating your data with other data they hold in order to inform advertising related services provided to other clients. These third parties may place a cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear across the Services, or on other websites, apps and services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. On mobile you can reset your settings by taking the following steps (for iOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074 and for Android: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the website or all functionality of our Services, and advertising will no longer be targeted to your interests. For example, we may collect and share the advertising identifier associated with your device (such as the Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Android Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device; in some instances you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID. We do not associate any of your personal information with your advertising device ID without your consent (which may be given by you in our terms of use for an Application).</p>

<p>VI. Security</p>

<p>madeny is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access. No security, however, can eliminate the possibility that your information may be accessed by an unauthorized third party and we cannot guarantee that your information will remain secure in all situations. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email, mail, telephone, or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. We reserve the right to choose which method we use to contact you about such an event. VII. International Transfer You are giving us the following particular express, voluntary, and informed consent to a few activities relating to your Personal Information that is disclosed in providing goods and services to you, or for a purpose directly related to such purpose: Consent to International Transfer and Disclosure of Personal Information: madeny is located in the United States (“U.S.”) and is subject to the applicable laws of the United States (where data privacy laws are less stringent than in the European Union and certain other jurisdictions). We will store and process information we receive about you, as described in this Privacy Policy, in the U.S. We may be involved in business activities in a variety of countries. You agree that madeny and those with whom we share your Personal Information (“Recipients”) may disclose, transfer, process, and store your Personal Information outside of your country of origin to our affiliates, sponsors and partners, and any other third party service providers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Some of the recipients of Personal Information as specified above may be located in countries that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to that set forth by the European Union and some other jurisdictions. If you submit any Personal Information or choose to access or use the Services offered by madeny, such as our website, you consent to such disclosure, transfer, process, and storage of information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and subject to such applicable laws which may include access by law enforcement and other government entities including courts and tribunals. If we do transfer Personal Information outside the U.S., we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it were being used in the U.S. We will use one of the following safeguards to ensure your information is protected:</p>

<p>Transfer the data to a non-EEA country that has privacy laws at least as protective as those within the EEA, or
Put in place a contract with the recipient of the data, which means the recipient must protect the data to the same standards as required within the EEA, or
Transfer it to organizations that are part of the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is a framework that sets out the standards for data to be sent between the United States and European countries. The Privacy Shield ensures that data are protected to the same standards as used within the EEA.
Consent to Electronic Notice If There is a Security Breach: We will safeguard your Personal Information and prevent such information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. If we or a Recipient is required to provide notice of unauthorized access to or other invasion of certain security systems, you agree that we (or they) may do so when required (or voluntarily) by posting notice on our website or sending notice to any email address we have for you, in our (or their) good faith discretion. You agree that notice to you will count as notice to others for whom you are acting, and agree to pass the notice on to them.
VIII. Our Policy Toward Children</p>

<p>These Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at contact@madeny.me. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

<p>IX. Phishing</p>

<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to madeny. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>

<p>X. Links to Other Sites</p>

<p>Our Services may provide links to other websites and applications. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

<p>XI. Complaints</p>

<p>If you have any complaints concerning madeny’s processing of your Personal Information, please email us at contact@madeny.me or write to us at 09 Avenue Lamartine 77270 Villeparisis France. Please note that if you are an EU Resident, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with a European Union supervisory authority that is responsible for the protection of Personal Information in the country where you live or work, or in which you think a breach of data protection laws might have taken place. You can learn more about these rights at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens_en.
